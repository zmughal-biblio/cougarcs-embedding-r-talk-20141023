## R-extensions and embedding R in Perl

CougarCS meeting on 2014-10-23

Talk notes are in the `talk.otl` file.

My code for embedding R in Perl is available at [embedding-r-in-perl](https://github.com/zmughal/embedding-r-in-perl-experiment).
This also depends on my data frame implementation at [data-frame-experiment](https://github.com/zmughal/data-frame-experiment).


Important websites:

- http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Rcpp.html
- http://adv-r.had.co.nz/C-interface.html

I hope to publish the code in the [Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org/).
